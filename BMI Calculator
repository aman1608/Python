# Below is a code block for calculating BMI Index of a person, and displaying the Weight Class against it:

try:
    w = float(input('Please enter your weight in kilograms: '))
    assert(w > 0)
    h = float(input('Please enter your height in meters.: '))
    assert(h > 0)
    BMI = w/(h**2)
    
    print('Your BMI is:' ,round(BMI,2))

#Below are the defined ranges for the BMI along with the weight classes:

    if BMI <= 18.5:
        print('You are Underweight')
    elif BMI <= 24.9:
        print('You are Normal')
    elif BMI <= 29.9:
        print('You are Overweight')
    else:
        print('You are Very Overweight')
        
# The user may enter a non-numeric value or a string as input, for which an exception is prompted with a message:

except (ValueError) as n:
    print("Please enter a numeric value")
    
#KeyboardInterrupt error occurs when a user hits interrupt while the program is running,for which an exception is prompted with a message:

except (KeyboardInterrupt) as p:
    print("Please dont press delete or cltrl+c key while the program is running")
    
#AssertionError occurs if the user enters a negative or 0 as the input, contrary to assert mentioned in the code, for which an exception is prompted with a message:

except (AssertionError) as q:
    print("Please enter a positive non zero value")
